## What's the Magic?

SemesterSync uses AI to read your syllabus and extract all the important dates and events. No more squinting at tiny text or missing deadlines because you forgot to add something to your calendar!

### Features 

- **Smart File Upload** - Drag & drop your PDF or DOCX syllabus (we're not picky!)
- **One-Click Calendar Sync** - Everything goes straight to your Google Calendar with a click of a button
- **Edit Before You Sync** - Review and tweak the extracted information before it hits your calendar, to make 100% sure all the info is correct.

###  What We Extract

- **Class Schedules** - Weekly meetings, locations, and times
- **Assignments** - Due dates, descriptions, and submission times
- **Tests & Exams** - Dates, times, locations, and duration
- **Semester Dates** - Start and end dates for proper calendar organization

## How It Works

### 1. **Upload Your Syllabus** 
Drag and drop your syllabus file (PDF or DOCX) onto the upload area. 

### 2. **Let the Magic Happen** 
AI analyzes your document and extracts all the important dates, times, and events. 

### 3. **Review & Edit** 
Take a look at what we found and make any adjustments. Add missing details, fix times, or modify descriptions - it's your calendar, after all!

### 4. **Sync to Calendar** 
One click sends everything to your Google Calendar with proper formatting, recurring events, and all the details you need to stay organized.
